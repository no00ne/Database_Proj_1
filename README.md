# Database_Proj_1
CS307 project No.1

This is about a the structure of a fictional Danmu video website â€“ Synchronized User-generated Subtitle Technology Company (SUSTC).



We got 3 files: users.csv, videos.csv and danmu.csv.



We plan to use 4 tables to manage all the data.
- Users: to store all data of users
- Video_Basic: to store basic data of videos
- Video_View: to record users who have viewed the video and their last watch time duration.
- Content: to store all contents in all videos, which we call "Dan Mu" in Chinese.
